# Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Implementations of popular deep RL algorithms. Written in Pytorch

Currently (as of Nov 21, 2019) this repository contains implementations of [A2C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf) and [PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347). I have not provided a more extended readme / how-to-use guide because I intend to continue adding more implementations here in the near-term future. Once the repository is in a more stable state, I intend add more detailed documentation.
